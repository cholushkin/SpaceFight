/* Match the pattern PATTERN against the string TEXT;
   return 1 if it matches, 0 otherwise.

   A match means the entire string TEXT is used up in matching.

   In the pattern string, `*' matches any sequence of characters,
   `?' matches any character, [SET] matches any character in the specified set,
   [!SET] matches any character not in the specified set.

   A set is composed of characters or ranges; a range looks like
   character hyphen character (as in 0-9 or A-Z).
   [0-9a-zA-Z_] is the set of characters allowed in C identifiers.
   Any other character in the pattern must be matched exactly.

   To suppress the special syntactic significance of any of `[]*?!-\',
   and match the character exactly, precede it with a `\'.
